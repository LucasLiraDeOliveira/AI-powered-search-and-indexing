# AI-powered-search-and-indexing
## Interface used
I used ElasticSearch for this test:
![Example pt. 1](./example1.jpg "Example pt. 1")

## Exemple used
![Example pt. 2](./example2.jpg "Example pt. 2")
![Example pt. 3](./example3.jpg "Example pt. 3")


## Conclusions
This type of tool was, to me, similar to plataforms like postman.
So its really likely to study more about HTTP Methods and using json for queries.
